## Description

In this First Peace Shooter you have the ability to go back in time and undo the killing.
Just be quick enough to collect each of the bullets at the position they were originally shot from.
Otherwise you lose. One level to practice, then three more to go.

Keep always in mind, you have to start from the end.
